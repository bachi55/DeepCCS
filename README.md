# DeepCCS
CCS prediction using deep neural network

### For the impatient:

DeepCCS predict -i **INPUT_F** -o **OUTPUT_F**

- **INPUT_F** is the input file with at least a “SMILES” and a “Adducts” columns
- **OUTPUT_F** is the desired name for the output file, if none stdout will be use
- The default model.h5, smiles_encoder.json and adducts_encoder.json files will be use


### Information

DeepCCS is still in alpha and under active development. You can still discover it yourself and available models should give accurate predictions.

More information about installation and usage will come soon...
